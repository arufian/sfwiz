# PluginRequest Class

PluginRequest Class Passes input parameters from the class that implements the Process.Plugin interface to the flow. Namespace [Process](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_namespace_process.htm "The Process namespace provides an interface and classes for passing data between your organization and a flow.") Tip We recommend using the @InvocableMethod annotation instead of the Process.Plugin interface.
            * The interface doesn’t support Blob, Collection, and sObject, data types, and it doesn’t support bulk operations. After you implement the interface on a class, the class can be referenced only from flows.
            * The annotation supports all data types and bulk operations. After you implement the annotation on a class, the class can be referenced from flows, processes, and the Custom Invocable Actions REST API endpoint.
            * Legacy Apex actions aren’t supported in auto-layout in Flow Builder. Legacy Apex actions are only available to be added in free-form in Flow Builder. Existing actions can be edited in both auto-layout and free-form mode.
