## ChangeEventHeader Properties

The following are properties for `ChangeEventHeader`.

- 
**[changedfields](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_changedfields)**

A list of the fields that were changed in an update operation, including the `LastModifiedDate` system field. This field is empty for other     operations, including record creation. This property is available in Apex saved using API     version 47.0 or later.

- 
**[changeorigin](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_changeorigin)**

Only populated for changes done by API apps or from Lightning Experience; empty     otherwise. The Salesforce API and the API client ID that initiated the change, if set by the     client. Use this field to detect whether your app initiated the change to not process the change     again and potentially avoid a deep cycle of changes.

- 
**[changetype](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_changetype)**

The operation that caused the change.

- 
**[commitnumber](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_commitnumber)**

The system change number (SCN) of a committed transaction, which increases     sequentially. This field is provided for diagnostic purposes. The field value is not guaranteed     to be unique in Salesforce—it is unique only in a single database instance. If your Salesforce     org migrates to another database instance, the commit number might not be unique or     sequential.

- 
**[committimestamp](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_committimestamp)**

The date and time when the change occurred, represented as the number of milliseconds     since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.

- 
**[commituser](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_commituser)**

The ID of the user that ran the change operation.

- 
**[difffields](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_difffields)**

Contains the names of fields whose values are sent as a unified diff       because they contain large text values.

- 
**[entityname](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_entityname)**

The API name of the standard or custom object that the change pertains to. For example,     Account or MyObject__c.

- 
**[nulledfields](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_nulledfields)**

Contains the names of fields whose values were changed to null in an       update operation. Use this field in Apex change event messages to determine if a field was       changed to null in an update and isn’t an unchanged field.

- 
**[recordids](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_recordids)**

One or more record IDs for the changed records. Typically, this field contains one     record ID. If in one transaction the same change occurred in multiple records of the same object     type during one second, Salesforce merges the change notifications. In this case, Salesforce     sends one change event for all affected records and the recordIds field     contains the IDs for all records that have the same change.

- 
**[sequencenumber](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_sequencenumber)**

The sequence of the change within a transaction. The sequence number starts from     1.

- 
**[transactionkey](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader.htm#apex_eventbus_ChangeEventHeader_transactionkey)**

A string that uniquely identifies each Salesforce transaction. You can use this key to     identify and group all changes that were made in the same transaction.

  ### changedfields

  
  
  
A list of the fields that were changed in an update operation, including the `LastModifiedDate` system field. This field is empty for other
    operations, including record creation. This property is available in Apex saved using API
    version 47.0 or later.

    
#### Signature

      
      `public List<String> changedfields {get;
        set;}`

      
    

    
#### Property Value

      
      Type: List<[String](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_methods_system_string)>

    

  

  ### changeorigin

  
  
  
Only populated for changes done by API apps or from Lightning Experience; empty
    otherwise. The Salesforce API and the API client ID that initiated the change, if set by the
    client. Use this field to detect whether your app initiated the change to not process the change
    again and potentially avoid a deep cycle of changes.

    
#### Signature

      
      `public String changeorigin {get; set;}`

      
    

    
#### Property Value

      
      Type: [String](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_methods_system_string)

      The format of the changeOrigin field value
        is:
```
com/salesforce/api/<API_Name>/<API_Version>;client=<Client_ID>
```

      
        - 
`<API_Name>` is the name of the Salesforce API
          used to make the data change. It can take one of these values: soap, rest, bulkapi,
          xmlrpc, oldsoap, toolingsoap, toolingrest, apex, apexdebuggerrest.

        - 
`<API_Version>` is the version of the API call
          that made the change and is in the format XX.X.

        - 
`<Client_ID>` is a string that contains the client
          ID of the app that initiated the change. If the client ID is not set in the API call,
            `client=<Client_ID>` is not appended to the
            changeOrigin field.

      

      
**Example:**
```
com/salesforce/api/soap/49.0;client=Astro
```

      The client ID is set in the Call Options header of an API call. For an example on how to
        set the Call Options header, see:

      
        - REST API: [Sforce-Call-Options Header](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.258.0.api_rest.meta/api_rest/headers_calloptions.htm). (Bulk API also uses the Sforce-Call-Options header.
          )

        - SOAP API: [CallOptions
            Header](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.258.0.api.meta/api/sforce_api_header_calloptions.htm). (Apex API also uses the CallOptions element.)

The system change number (SCN) of a committed transaction, which increases
    sequentially. This field is provided for diagnostic purposes. The field value is not guaranteed
    to be unique in Salesforce—it is unique only in a single database instance. If your Salesforce
    org migrates to another database instance, the commit number might not be unique or
    sequential.

    
#### Signature

      
      `public Long commitnumber {get; set;}`

#### Property Value

      
      Type: [String](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_methods_system_string)

    

  

### nulledfields

Contains the names of fields whose values were changed to null in an
      update operation. Use this field in Apex change event messages to determine if a field was
      changed to null in an update and isn’t an unchanged field.

#### Signature

`public List<String> nulledfields {get; set;}`

#### Property Value

Type: List<String>

  ### recordids

  
  
  
One or more record IDs for the changed records. Typically, this field contains one
    record ID. If in one transaction the same change occurred in multiple records of the same object
    type during one second, Salesforce merges the change notifications. In this case, Salesforce
    sends one change event for all affected records and the recordIds field
    contains the IDs for all records that have the same change.

    
#### Signature

      
      `public List<String> recordids {get; set;}`

      
    

    
#### Property Value

Type: List<String>

Examples of
      operations with same changes are:
        - Update of fieldA to valueA in Account records.

        - Deletion of Account records.

        - Renaming or replacing a picklist value that results in updating the field value in all
          affected records.

      
The recordIds field can contain a wildcard value when a change
        event message is generated for custom field type conversions that cause data loss. In this
        case, the recordIds value is the three-character prefix of the object,
        followed by the wildcard character `*`. For example, for
        accounts, the value is `001*`.

  

  ### sequencenumber

  
  
  
The sequence of the change within a transaction. The sequence number starts from
    1.

    
#### Signature

      
      `public Integer sequencenumber {get; set;}`

      
    

    
#### Property Value

      
      Type: [Integer](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_integer.htm#apex_methods_system_integer)

      A lead conversion is an example of a transaction that can have multiple changes. A lead
        conversion results in the following sequence of changes, all within the same
        transaction.

      
        - Create an account

        - Create a contact

        - Create an opportunity

        - Update a lead

      

    

  

  ### transactionkey

  
  
  
A string that uniquely identifies each Salesforce transaction. You can use this key to
    identify and group all changes that were made in the same transaction.

    
#### Signature

      
      `public String transactionkey {get; set;}`

      
    

    
#### Property Value

      
      Type: [String](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_methods_system_string)
