# Continuation Class

You can’t catch an assertion failure using a try/catch block even though it’s logged as an exception.Continuation Class Use the Continuation class to make callouts asynchronously to a SOAP or REST Web service. Namespace [System](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_namespace_System.htm "The System namespace provides classes and methods for core Apex functionality.") Example For a code example, see [Make Long-Running Callouts from a Visualforce Page](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.258.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_continuation_overview.htm).

            * **[Continuation(timeout)](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_System_Continuation.htm#apex_System_Continuation_ctor)**  
Creates an instance of the Continuation class by using the specified timeout in seconds. The timeout maximum is 120 seconds.

The map key is the request label, and the map value is the corresponding HTTP request. getResponse(requestLabel) Returns the response for the request that corresponds to the specified label. Signature public static HttpResponse getResponse(String requestLabel) Parameters

requestLabel
    Type: [String](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_methods_system_string "Contains methods for the String primitive data type.")
    The request label to get the response for.
Return Value Type: [HttpResponse](atlas.en-us.258.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_classes_restful_http_httpresponse.htm#apex_classes_restful_http_httpresponse "Use the HttpResponse class to handle the HTTP response returned by the Http class.") Usage The status code is returned in the HttpResponse object and can be obtained by calling getStatusCode() on the response. A status code of 200 indicates that the request was successful. Other status code values indicate the type of problem that was encountered. **Sample of Error Status Codes** When a problem occurs with the response, some possible status code values are:
            * 2000: The timeout was reached, and the server didn’t get a chance to respond.
            * 2001: There was a connection failure.
            * 2002: Exceptions occurred.
            * 2003: The response hasn’t arrived (which also means that the Apex asynchronous callout framework hasn’t resumed).
            * 2004: The response size is too large (greater than 1 MB).
